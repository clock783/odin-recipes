# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Recipe Project
The Objective of this project is to practice what I have learned using HTML so far
by creating a simple HTML recipe website. The website will have a homepage with three
links on it; each to a different recipe page I will create.

Skills I will practice with this project are as follows:
- Git basics
- Github basics
- Creating HTML boilerplate (from scratch)
- Embedding links
- Ordered & unordered lists
